# TacoCloud_Spring5
## A web full-stack project learning Spring 5 

## Brief Introduction
This is a project I'm currently working on. I'm teaching myself to develop a web-app using the book *spring-in-action-5*, and I'm following the **Taco-cloud** example it has to get my hands dirty.

While working on with this project, I just upload it my current work to my github account in case I made some changes and made a bug that I cannot resolve. (In case this happens, I used github to store previous version, so in worse
case I'm still able to return the project into a previous stage). 

**This project is not on my resume, and it is not finished yet. I'm still working on it.**

Thanks.
